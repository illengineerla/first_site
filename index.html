            <p class="text-warning">Born and raised in Boston, Massachusetts, a scout is a fast-running bully with a baseball bat, who has an artsy habit of expressing everything "straight to the face." He is very rude and thinks he can do anything. This is the fastest mercenary on the battlefield, which allows him to leave opponents far behind, and a double jump helps him navigate the terrain and dodge counter shells. The scout is armed with a sawn-off shotgun, a pistol and a bat, which makes it an ideal class for aggressive combat and entering the rear. He effectively uses the tactic of “strike and run” - he runs up, quickly attacks the enemy and runs away, until no one understood.</p>

As shown in the video "Meet the Pyro", he lives in Pyrolandia - the beautiful world of his own fantasies. Using a homemade flamethrower, the arsonist can set fire to opponents, negating their health with the help of subsequent damage from burning out. Because of the small range of the flamethrower, the arsonist is weak at long distances and relies more on ambush and surprise, trying to take enemies off guard.</p>

He is a true master of work with explosives, excellent deal with enemies at middle and near distances. Armed with a grenade launcher and a sticky stick, the bomber uses his skills and a single eye to send opponents straight to heaven, often piecemeal. If the enemy is able to get close, he is surprised to find that the demolition man is very good in close combat, because he has a wide choice of the appropriate weapon.</p>

Possessing the greatest store of health and the most impressive gun, he certainly forces him to reckon with himself. His firepower is very high, he is able to stop the avalanche of enemies, pouring them with lead rain from his machine gun. However, with the gun untwisted, the machine-gunner becomes slow, like a snail, turning into one big target for any enemy - be it a sniper who is far enough away, or a spy who has cunningly crept up from his back. Being an excellent partner for the doctor, replenishing the cartridges and health from the distributor of the engineer, or simply supporting with fire any comrade - the machine gunner, once again confirming the name of the game, fully demonstrates his best qualities in the team. Help him too, and he will definitely share with you his Sandwich - the most delicious first-aid kit in the game.</p>

On the battlefield, the sniper’s main role is to knock out the enemy’s important targets, using his sniper rifle and aiming precisely at the head, instantly killing any opponent. Extremely effective at a distance and rather weak in melee due to the fact that he is forced to use Kukri or PMM. That is why it is convenient for a sniper to lie down in a hard-to-reach spot at some peak, from where he can easily send enemies to the next world.</p>
